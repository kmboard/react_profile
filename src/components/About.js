        <p>My name is Kija Board, pronounced like the car 'Kia'. I graduated Georgia State in 2015 with a degree in Psychology 
                 and Hospitality. I am currently enrolled in Georgia Tech coding bootcamp to learn full Stack coding.
                My true love is art, I have a background in graphic design and photography. 
                 I have a deep love for painting. My favorite artist is Frida Kahlo, because she loved herself unconditionally. 
                 She painted herself flaws and all, as women we tend to get lost our physical appearance. 
                 One of the most important things to me is women empowerment, 
                 teaching women to love themselves as Frida did, unconditionally.
